## Contributing 
if you have any feedback about my website, feel free to open a github issue or [contact me!](https://mae.wtf/contact)

if you would like to submit a fake ad, submit a github issue (or pull request) with your asset and preferred credit name. the ad must fit the following guidelines:

- resolution must be **288x160**
- the file format must be either **png**, **jpg**, **gif** or **webm**. you can also submit an mp4 and this will be converted and compressed to webm
- the fake ad must not be advertising a real service.
it's called a *fake* ad for a reason!
- if you're going to advertise yourself, be funny about
it. unfunny and serious submissions will be rejected
